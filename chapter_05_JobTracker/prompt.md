Create a local-first Job Tracker as a single-page React application scaffolded with Vite. All data must persist in the browser using IndexedDB (use the `idb` library for a cleaner async API). No backend or authentication is needed.

Data Model — Each job card stores:

- Company name (text, required)

- Job title / role (text, required)

- LinkedIn job URL (URL, clickable)

- Resume used (text / dropdown of previously used resume names, e.g., "SDE_Resume_v3", "QA_Lead_Resume")

- Date applied (auto-set on creation, editable)

- Salary range (optional text, e.g., "₹25-30 LPA" or "$150-180K")

- Notes (optional textarea for recruiter name, referral info, etc.)

- Status (maps to Kanban column)

Kanban Columns (drag-and-drop between them):

1. Wishlist — Saved jobs I haven't applied to yet

2. Applied — Application submitted

3. Follow-up — Followed up with recruiter / referral

4. Interview — Currently in interview rounds

5. Offer — Received an offer

6. Rejected — Got a rejection

Core Features:

- Drag-and-drop cards between columns (use `@dnd-kit/core`  or `react-beautiful-dnd` )

- Add new job via a modal/slide-over form

- Edit any card inline or via modal

- Delete a card with confirmation

- Card shows: company name, role, resume tag, days since applied, and a clickable LinkedIn icon/link

- Column headers show the count of cards in each column

- Search/filter bar to find jobs by company name or role

- All CRUD operations persist instantly to IndexedDB

Nice-to-Have (implement if straightforward):

- Light/dark mode toggle

- Export all data as JSON for backup

- Import JSON to restore data

- Sort cards within a column by date (newest/oldest)

Tech Stack & Constraints:

- React 18+ with functional components and hooks

- Vite for build tooling

- Tailwind CSS for styling (clean, minimal UI)

- `idb`  npm package for IndexedDB wrapper

- No external database, no API calls — 100% local

- Responsive layout (usable on laptop + tablet)

UI/UX Notes:

- Clean, professional look — think Linear or Trello-minimal

- Each column should be scrollable independently

- Cards should have subtle color coding or left-border accent per status

- The form should validate required fields before saving
